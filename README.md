# README

This is my personal repository for managing my Neovim configuration. 
It was a fork of kickstart.nvim but it turned out into something totally difernt.

Feel free to try it out!


## How to install

Linux and Mac

```
git clone git@github.com:trueGmek/config.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```
